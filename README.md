# Python-final-project
Python class final project

Final project of python class, a patient management tool, and a gas price statistics tool.


Patient Management Program specifications:
This project is to develop a program that manages patient information and the procedures a patient received in a hospital. The patient information includes:

Patient ID
First name, last name
Address, city, state, ZIP code
Phone number
Name and phone of emergency contact

Procedure information include:
Patient ID
Name of the procedure
Date of the procedure
Name of the practitioner who performed the procedure
Chares for the procedure

The program is to support these functionalities:
•	Add a patient and his or her procedure(s)
•	Add procedure for an existing patient
•	Look up for a patient by patient ID or first and last name, display the patient information and his or her procedure(s), calculate total charges
•	Change patient information
•	Delete a patient and all his or her procedure(s)
•	Importing data into the system from two CSV text files: patient.txt and procedure.txt
•	Export data to text files as json patient.json and procedure.json for data exchange

Present a menu that lets user perform the above tasks

Gas Price Statistics Program Specifications:
For this project, you are to develop one or more programs that read the data from the data file, and perform these tasks:
Average Price Per Year: Calculate the average price of gas per year, for each year in the file.
Average Price Per Month: Calculate the average price for each month in the file.
Highest and Lowest Prices Per Year: For each year in the data file, determine the date and amount for the lowest price, and the highest price.
List of Prices, Lowest to Highest: Generate a text file that lists the dates and prices. Sorted from lowest price to the highest.
List of Prices, Highest to Lowest: Generate a test file that lists the dates and prices. Sorted from highest price to the lowest.
You may write one program to do all these tasks, or write multiple programs, one for each task.
